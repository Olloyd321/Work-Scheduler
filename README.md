# Work-Scheduler
This repo is for the 05 Module challenge "Work Day Scheduler"
<br>
#### The purpose of this challenge is to display my understanding of using API's such as Jquery and DayJS
<br>


## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Challenges
The most challenging part of this project was *again* how to save info to storage *and* then displaying that information.
I am usually able to at some point able to get *something* saved to local storage
